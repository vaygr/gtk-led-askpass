	* Version 0.10.
	* Make the dialog stay on top, so that windows that get opened after
	  the dialog don't obscure it.

	* Version 0.9.
	* Makefile:
	  - use LDFLAGS rather than LIBS
	  - use cflags and ldflags rather than CFLAGS and LDFLAGS

	* Version 0.8.
	* Explicitly focus the LED widget for GTK+ 2.4.

	* Version 0.7.
	* Change led_area_key_press_handler() to use
	  gtk_accelerator_get_default_mod_mask(). This makes the key handling
	  much saner. Thanks to Federico Mena Quintero for documenting how to
	  do this properly.
	* Split out clearing the widget to a seperate function, clear().

	* Version 0.6.
	* Make it work with NumLock on. The procedure for getting characters
	  from key values is all a bit suspect, really. At the moment, we just
	  ignore keys pressed when Control is held down.
	* Add reference to ssh-askpass(1) in manpage.

	* Seperate Debian packaging into a seperate patch.
